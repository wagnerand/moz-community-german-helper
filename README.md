moz-community-german-helper
===========================

This Firefox Add-on makes the life of the moderators of the Mozilla community-german mailinglist easier.
It automatically inserts the text in data/mail-reject.txt into the reject text field as soon as the moderator clicks the "Reject" radio button.

No more copy and pasting from a local text file, an etherpad or somewhere else!
